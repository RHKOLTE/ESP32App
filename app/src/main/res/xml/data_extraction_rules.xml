            Use <include> and <exclude> tags to control what is backed up to the cloud.
            You can specify domains (like file, database, sharedpref) and paths.

            Example:
            <include domain="sharedpref" path="settings.xml"/>
            <exclude domain="database" path="user_cache.db"/>
